### CPSC 120

Lab 1

Lab 1, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I was able to explore my curiosity and expand my horizons regarding machine coding. 
While the first lab was very basic, being able to learn how to comment on our code and make it more clean and readable for other 
programmes was incredible and taught us how to be proactive and well rounded programers.

Lab 3

Lab 3, Part 1 was one of my most eye opening labs as I was introduced to math equations through the example of finding the unit price 
for a pizza given its size and portions. Being able to incorporate multiplication, additions, subtraction and division into our code 
was harder than it looked. Through our lecture classes I was able to learn and identify which operators to use and how to manipulate 
given the context of the questions and what the code was required to do. Overall, this lab was a great way to implement math operators
and work towards our goal to learn more applications to programming.

Lab 4

Lab 4, Part 1 was one of my most challenging and interesting labs as it required me to identify and use the conversion ratios for the 
change between measurements. This lab was very useful as it required all the components we had previously seen before and applied it 
as a compound organism. The use of cin and cout statements, the use of double and int to differentiate between decimals and whole 
numbers was useful to be more precise. Overall, this lab was very impactful and set the stage for what our future labs would look like.
